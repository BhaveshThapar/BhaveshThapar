# 👋 Hi, I'm Bhavesh Sachin Thapar

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland with a passion for building intelligent, user-focused software. I enjoy working across the full stack, whether it’s designing interactive frontends, writing scalable APIs, or integrating machine learning into real-world applications. I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code and using technology to solve meaningful problems.

Currently, I’m seeking **Software Engineering or Machine Learning Engineering internships** that allow me to apply my knowledge and build products that make a tangible impact.
